# Picasso2Glide

The task revolves around two libs [Picasso](http://square.github.io/picasso/) and [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide).

This project is written using Picasso, your task is to convert it to Glide (i.e. do the exact same thing that the app does right now but with Glide instead of Picasso)

It consists of 4 sub-tasks which you have to accomplish using Glide:

1. Simply load an image using Glide
2. Circle transform
3. Add a callback so you know when the image has been loaded
4. Synchronously fetch an image in an AsyncTask
5. Invalidate the image cache and reload from network

Note : There are 5 ImageViews in MainActivity, each ImageView is for one task as mentioned above.
